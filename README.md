# Project Idea - Home Based Daily Task Manager
## Initial idea:
“I had an idea for our app. I'm a little older than most students, and I have 2 children. My son William has slight ADHD and autism. Think Sheldon from Big Bang Theory. One thing that I find for him is that he really needs a very regimented sand strict schedule (I'm not talking about a calendar app!). Everything needs to be spelled out, and minimal surprises (he just can't cope). So the app would be task based, have you eaten breakfast? have you brushed your teeth? have you put dirty clothes in the hamper? done homework etc etc. Tick off the ones that are complete (in a fun way) then maybe message another device that's owned by the parent/caregiver when tasks are completed or not completed. There could be a reward system for when tasks are done.”

* Target audience: children below ~12 i.e assumed they are with a parent or teacher
* First installation parent sets up the tasks
* Admin/user functionality
* Rewards system for completion of all the tasks
* Relationship between devices, swap  between modes
* Email alert to parents phone
* Integration with google calendar

Set it up in a way that it could be used for anyone who wants to manage their scheduling, checks/reminders

* Main screen has tasks assigned by the parent or guardian, that need to be completed by the child
* Reward based system, the child can customise a fun avatar, similar to Androidify app
* When the child completes tasks, they earn points for unlocking new features for the avatar e.g. new eyes, mouth, clothes, etc
* From the child's perspective, the main point of the app is to customise an avatar (it’s at the top of the app)
* From the parent/caregivers perspective, the main point of the app is for the child to complete tasks, and the avatar is just a nice add-on to keep the child focused or entertained
